<h1>Sign Language Project</h1>
1.Objective<br>
     Create a machine learning model that recognises the sign and translates it from ASL(American Sign Language) to English<br>
2.Need for Such a Model<br>
     This model allows those who are not well versed in ASL to easily translate from sign to spoken English. Further, being proficient in ASL allows you to communicate with<br>
      a wide range of hearing, hard of hearing, and deaf individuals. It also helps solve the real-world problems of sign language recognition.<br>
3.How does the Model Work<br>
      The model has been trained using 105 pictures, taken in different angles and lightings, each of the different letters in ASL. On running the the program, a
      webcam opens that allows the user to take a picture of the sign needed to be translated and the output of the program in return gives the letter which was being
      displayed<br>
